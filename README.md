This project focuses on developing a captcha recognition system using a convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Captcha is a way to protect websites from computer attacks or malware. Captcha is usually an image containing random characters, numbers or symbols, requiring users to enter them correctly to continue accessing the website.

With the use of CNN model, we can analyze the captcha image into different features and recognize the characters, numbers or symbols in the image. This will help us eliminate the need to require users to enter characters in captcha, improving the user experience.

To carry out this project, we need a captcha dataset for training and evaluating the effectiveness of the model. Then, we use the CNN model to train and build a captcha recognition system.

The result of the project will be an effective captcha recognition system that can be integrated into websites to help protect them from computer attacks and malware.
